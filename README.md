# Introduction to Motion Pro
**Motion Pro is a powerful motion graphics tool that is designed for anyone, regardless of their skill level.**

High quality graphics are usually reserved for only the top streamers. We wanted to change this by making it possible for **anyone to create stunning graphics**, no matter their skills or platform.

That's why we created Motion Pro, an easy and user-friendly solution to editing high quality templates using [Discord](https://discord.com/). All of our graphics are made with [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) and intelligently rendered using the [Expressions](https://ae-expressions.docsforadobe.dev/) platform.
